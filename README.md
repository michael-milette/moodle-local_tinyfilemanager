# Basic Overview

This is a port of Tiny File Manager for Moodle LMS. It supports multiple-languages storing, uploading, editing and managing files and folders in your website. The plugin runs on Moodle 3.0+. It includes build-in support for creating and managing text files and it supports syntax highlighting for over 150+ code languages.

Because it can be used by Site Administrators in such a way that your Moodle site can become disabled, we recommend that it only be used by qualified trusted Moodle Site Administrators.
